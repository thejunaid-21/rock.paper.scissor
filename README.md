# rock.paper.scissor
In our project we address the problem of how to implement a two player game while minimizing trust in  third-parties. Rock-Paper-Scissors is a hand game usually played between two people, in which each  player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand. These shapes are "rock",  "paper" and "scissors".
